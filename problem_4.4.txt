PROBLEM 4 CHAPTER 4
BOOK: JAVA PROGRAMING FROM THE BEGINNING BY K. N. KING

Make the following changes to the checkISBN program (section
3.10):

(a) If the user's input is not 13 characters long or does not
contain exactly three dashes, have the program prompt the 
user to re-enter the input. The program will repeat the prompt
as often as necessary until the input meets these criteria.

(b) Use a loop to calculate the values of the total variable

(c) Instead of printing the original check digit and the
computed check digit, have the program to display either
ISBN is valid( uf the check digits match) or ISBN is not valid
(if they don't)
